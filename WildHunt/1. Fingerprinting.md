# Fingerprinting

Basically trying to identify what the Application is made up of, what services are running, what CMS, or CDN etc is being used. 

THIS HELPS US IDENTIFY WHETHER WE NEED TO SPEND TIME ON A TARGET OR NOT.

We do this to narrow down our the attack on the target. To make a precision attack.

**Using Builtwith:**

https://www.builtwith.com 

**Using Wappalyzer:**

use extension on either chrome or mozilla.

**Using whatweb:**

`whatweb target.com`

**Using masscan:**

`masscan -p1-65535 $(dig +short target.com) --rate 10000`

**Using nmap:**

`nmap -sV -p <ports from masscan> target.com

**Using Aquatone:**

`cat target_subdomain_file.txt |aquatone -chrome-path /root/hacking/chromium-latest-linux/latest/chrome`
