***So this was all about manual technique to find sensitive information on github, lets move to some automated technique.***

## Automated Technique - Using Tools

However automation makes the process easy and fast but it also has it’s own drawback of false-positive results. Not every time the result is false-positive but sometimes it may happen. I have some automated tools that will help you to find sensitive things on github.

### 1. TruggleHog :

It is easy to use. It searches through git repositories for secrets, digging deep into commit history and branches. This is effective at finding secrets accidentally committed.

**Git Repo:** 

[dxa4481/truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog)

Searches through git repositories for secrets, digging deep into
commit history and branches. This is effective at finding secrets
accidentally committed.

```jsx
NEW
```

```jsx
truffleHog previously functioned by running entropy checks on git
diffs. This functionality still exists, but high signal regex checks
have been added, and the ability to surpress entropy checking has also
been added.
```

```
truffleHog --regex --entropy=False https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog.git

```

```jsx
or
```

```
truffleHog file:///user/dxa4481/codeprojects/truffleHog/

```

```jsx
With the -include_paths and -exclude_paths options, it is also possible to limit scanning to a subset of objects
in the Git history by defining regular expressions (one per line) in a
file to match the targeted object paths. To illustrate, see the example
include and exclude files below:
```

```jsx
*include-patterns.txt:*
```

```jsx
src/ # lines beginning with "#" are treated as comments and are ignored
gradle/ # regexes must match the entire path, but can use python's regex syntax for
# case-insensitive matching and other advanced options
(?i).*\.(properties|conf|ini|txt|y(a)?ml)$
(.*/)?id_[rd]sa$
```

```jsx
*exclude-patterns.txt:*
```

```jsx
(.*/)?\.classpath$
.*\.jmx$
(.*/)?test/(.*/)?resources/
```

```jsx
These filter files could then be applied by:
```

```jsx
trufflehog --include_paths include-patterns.txt --exclude_paths exclude-patterns.txt file://path/to/my/repo.git
```

```jsx
With these filters, issues found in files in the root-level src directory would be reported, unless they had the .classpath or .jmx extension, or if they were found in the src/test/dev/resources/ directory, for example. Additional usage information is provided when calling trufflehog with the h or -help options.
```

```jsx
These features help cut down on noise, and makes the tool easier to shove into a devops pipeline.
```

```jsx

```

USAGE: [`trufflehog.py](http://trufflehog.py/) --regex --entropy=False [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<yourTargetRepo>`

### 2. GitHub Dork:

It is a simple python tool that can search through your repository or your organization/user repositories.

**How to use it ?**

1. Go to [https://github.com/techgaun/github-dorks](https://github.com/techgaun/github-dorks)  and clone it (download it)
2. Install all the given requirements
3. Use the below given command to search for all the repositories of a single user

USAGE: python [github-dork.py](http://github-dork.py/) -u <username>

### 3. Watchtower:

AI-powered scanner to detect API keys, secrets, sensitive information. Watchtower Radar API lets you integrate with GitHub public or private repository, AWS, GitLab, Twilio, etc. The scan results are available on a web interface or CLI output. You can read more about it here : [https://radar.nightfall.ai/docs#get-results](https://radar.nightfall.ai/docs#get-results) . Basically it is a web application that helps you to scan github repositories.

**How to use it ?**

1. Go to [https://radar.nightfall.ai/](https://radar.nightfall.ai/)  and login with your github account.
2. Simply add your github’s target URL on the left top section for scanning

![https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*GvkFdJfo_f5tApiIX6bQbw.png?q=20](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*GvkFdJfo_f5tApiIX6bQbw.png?q=20)

3. After the scan is completed click on results to view the information and you’ll be redirected to another page like below one.

Now click on GitHub to see the leaked information on github

[https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)  
[https://git-secret.io/](https://git-secret.io/)

NOTE : If you find any API key or credentials or any other sensitive information under test directory then do not report it because that is an intended behaviour.
